# Rapid Azure Application Development

_Unlock the promise of Cloud and AI-powered rapid prototyping._

Collaborate with our team of Azure experts to create a shareable, living prototype, typically in 2-4 weeks.

Together we'll build an deployable, executable prototype, suitable for architectural testing (feasibility, cost of operation, modifiability, conceptual integrity, etc).

As much about learning and communication as the system itself, we believe prototypes are among the best vehicles to explore new technologies, clarify complex ideas, or even challenge strongly-held opinions.

After delivery, we can work with you to reap maximal benefits from the prototype, whether you're incorporating it into an amazing demo for stakeholders, or handing off to developers as an executable architectural diagram.
